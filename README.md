#React_Fetch_Display_Data
This assignment was to create your own project that fetches and renders data from an external source with React.

Objectives:

Data source: Fetch data from an external source and build a site and user experience around those data. 
Data rendering and manipulation: Organize and display the data you fetch in a way that is appropriate to the story you are trying to tell with the data (e.g., you would likely display weather data differently than a list of books). In this case, it is important to ensure that your React components are clean and organized. This is an opportunity to practice with useEffect and useReducer.
Styles: Explore Bootstrap themes to style your site and display your data. Reflect on common conventions youâ€™ve experienced on websites as a user and try to replicate what seemed intuitive to you.
